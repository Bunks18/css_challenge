# Intro

In this challenge you will be required to refactor CSS.

In the `index.html` file there is a sample resume that is using the css propoerty `float` to display two `div`s side by side.

## Instructions

Refactor the CSS using `flexbox` and `css grid` to accomplish the same side by side effect that the `float` property is currently used for.

In the section with the class `css-flexbox` use `flexbox`.

In the section with the class `css-grid` use `css-grid`.
